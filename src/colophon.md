1. I miss the corners of the internet where you'd Google some niche thing and one person with a blog had already written about it. You'd go look at it and they'd have shown their homework and given it to you without watching two minutes of video first or showing you a bunch of ads. These corners still exist and it's still possible and I'd like to be a part of it — sharing knowledge under the premise of "from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs."
1. No ads, no Patreon, etc. If I've written something useful and you'd like to contribute financially in some way then you can buy yourself a membership to [Scenic Routes Community Bicycle Center](https://scenicroutessf.com).
1. No comments because I don't need to publish what people say on the internet.

## Technical Bits

1. This website is served on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) with their [analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) turned on. Cloudflare claims their analytics does not fingerprint users and is "privacy-first." I can confirm that they do not give me individual user details such as IP addresses, cookies, etc. It's always possible they lie and track it for themselves but don't show me. The images are served from a [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket.
1. No [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). That means no pop-up asking you to accept cookie usage.
1. Minimal CSS. No custom fonts causing a page re-layout and extra network usage. Dark and light mode support.
1. Written in Markdown and statically generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)[^1] — to which I am an Open Collective [contributor](https://opencollective.com/emily-horsman).
1. This blog is image-heavy and that's important to me. However, all images are: compressed as much as I think is possible without sacrificing quality too much; served in modern formats (AVIF and WebP); offered in [multiple resolutions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) so that your browser can select the smallest appropriate size; and most are [lazily loaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading).
