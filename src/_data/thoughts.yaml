  post: Is there a difference between M05 and B05S Shimano brake pads?
    There's not much mention of the M05 ones by Shimano but they seem to be older ones for mechanical brakes. They're the same B-type shape. I can't imagine it matters much??


    Also a bit of a bummer that [egret](/tags/egret) came with resin-only brake calipers and rotors.

  post: Why is my [Brompton](/tags/n-judah-explore) so comfortable?
    It really feels like it shouldn't be â€” 16" x 35mm tires and narrow bars with barely any backsweep. But it is!
    I wonder if I could go multi-modal touring on it with some fairly long bike distances.
    I still want to try riding it to my day job office in the South Bay off the 8 at Bayshore & Tunnel Ave.


    And it climbs quite well! For having an easiest gear of [25 gear inches](https://gears.emilyhorsman.com/?@$id:0&l=N%20Judah%20Explore&f@:38;&r@:13&:16;&h@:0.64&:1&:1.57;&c:0.17&b:0.349&t:0.035).


    Also I passed by a very British(tm) sounding person on my ride today (who was riding and sheperding two kids on bikes) and she told her kids to "say hi to the Brompton" and told me she missed her Brompton so much.
