    Took the long way to and from an errand in reasonably heavy rain and it was amazing! I love biking in the rain!


    1. No squeaking from the waxed chain and I don't think any rust developed but we'll see on the next ride when dry.

    1. Played chicken with my e-bike battery — had one bar of battery left while in the Marina and went through the Presidio and up Arguello back home. Success!

    1. Rain cape and rain pants did admirably. Still haven't quite figured out having the hood over my helmet but my head didn't get very wet anyway.

    1. Regretted not bringing my overshoes. I think I want to get a custom pair of waterproof boots made somewhere (my feet are weirdly sized).

    1. I didn't have a camera on me so I don't have any photos and I really regret that. I took the bike path up to the Presidio Promenade and everywhere I looked was beautiful. The skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge through the thick rain make me want to bike right back there but my shoes are soaked and I have plans.

    1. My janky [too-small fender setup](/posts/its-fall-yall-time-for-fenders/) was insufficient for heavier rains :(

  post: Is there a difference between M05 and B05S Shimano brake pads?
    There's not much mention from Shimano about the M05 ones but they seem to be older and for mechanical brakes. They're the same B-type shape. I can't imagine it matters much??


    Also a bit of a bummer that [egret](/tags/egret) came with resin-only brake calipers and rotors.

  post: Why is my [Brompton](/tags/n-judah-explore) so comfortable?
    It really feels like it shouldn't be — 16" x 35mm tires and narrow bars with barely any backsweep. But it is!
    I wonder if I could go multi-modal touring on it with some fairly long bike distances.
    I still want to try riding it to my day job office in the South Bay off the 8 at Bayshore & Tunnel Ave.


    And it climbs quite well! For having an easiest gear of [25 gear inches](https://gears.emilyhorsman.com/?@$id:0&l=N%20Judah%20Explore&f@:38;&r@:13&:16;&h@:0.64&:1&:1.57;&c:0.17&b:0.349&t:0.035).


    Also I passed by a very British(tm) sounding person on my ride today (who was riding and sheperding two kids on bikes) and she told her kids to "say hi to the Brompton" and told me she missed her Brompton so much.
