Notably this is all stuff that doesn't involve the abhorrent act of throwing your bike in a car. There are plenty of great spots that are accessible without using a car or plane ‚Äî I'd prefer to pick these rather than find places I want to go and assume I can use climate-destroying means to get there. Besides, it's so fun to look at all the trail and transit maps in the area. üöè

## New-to-Me Stuff

1. [M√°yyan ‚ÄòOoy√°kma ‚Äì Coyote Ridge](https://www.openspaceauthority.org/preserves/coyoteridge.html) Open Space Preserve

   Bay Nature did an [article](https://baynature.org/article/new-south-bay-preserve-protects-endangered-species/) on this new open space preserve that got me excited about visiting here. Taking Caltrain down to Tamien and getting to the preserve via the [Coyote Creek Trail](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/3037/2058). A mostly car-free 16 miles to get there.

1. [American River Parkway Trail](https://regionalparks.saccounty.gov/Parks/Pages/JedediahSmith.aspx) in Sacramento

   Taking the [ferry](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/routes-schedules/oakland-alameda/) from SF to Jack London Square where we can take the Amtrak [Capital Corridor](https://www.amtrak.com/capitol-corridor-train). 32 miles of car-free multi-use path!

1. [San Bruno Mountain](https://www.smcgov.org/parks/san-bruno-mountain-state-county-park)

   Saddle Trail and others are available for biking and it's not too hard to get here. I also haven't done the climb up on Gaudalupe Canyon Pkwy in a long while.

1. [China Camp](https://friendsofchinacamp.org/visit-the-park/activities/)

   I've never been up here and it seems a bit annoying to bike to. But Shoreline and Bay View Trail look great and it's something fairly different for me! Bay Area Rides has a [good page](https://bayarearides.com/rides/chinacamp/) on a loop ride. I'd probably take the ferry to Larkspur and enter the park from the north-west because it'd be a pretty long day otherwise.

1. [Miwok and Old Springs Trail](https://www.trailforks.com/route/marincello-bobcat-miwok-and-old-springs-loop/) in Marin

   I need to do the Miwok ‚Üí Old Springs ‚Üí Marincello ‚Üí Bobcat loop!

1. [Los Angeles River Path](https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2023-08-03/birdwatching-bike-ride-la-river-elysian-valley-path-the-wild)

   I walked a bit of this path earlier this year but I want to bike the whole thing. Although not all of it is completed. We can bring our bikes on the Amtrak [Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train) (again)!

1. Visitacion Valley to the South Bay on the Brompton

   Taking [Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/routes/8-bayshore) to Visitacion Valley takes exactly as long as biking to it from me. If I transit there I skip a lot of hills, which means I could take the Brompton and then have a flat 30 mile ride through San Mateo.

1. [Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org)

   I'd like to put my bike on SMART somewhere! TBD where.

1. [Calero County Park](https://parks.sccgov.org/santa-clara-county-parks/calero-county-park)

   Another one from [Bay Area Rides](https://bayarearides.com/rides/calero/). Scenic and not difficult! Taking Caltrain from Tamien and going along the [Los Alamitos Creek Trail](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/2997/2058) means a fairly car-lite way to get there.

1. [Fort Ord](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/fort-ord-national-monument)

   I biked through some of this between Santa Cruz and Monterey back in 2021. I was only on the [Monterey Bay Coastal Trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail/monterey-bay-coastal-recreation-trail/) and I've been wanting to go back through there ever since. It almost feels like a giant, calmer, Ocean Beach with all the sand dunes.

1. [Iron Horse Trail](https://www.ebparks.org/trails/interpark/iron-horse)

   We missed when East Bay Bike Party went through here at night but tbh I want to go through during the day anyway. 31 miles of car-free, flat multi-use path for when I want something chill! BART to Walnut Creek and visit [Riv](https://www.rivbike.com) at the same time. Another good one for the Brompton.

1. [Lake Chabot](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/lake-chabot)

   Once again Bay Area Rides has a [good page](https://bayarearides.com/rides/lakechabot/). Can get there from either Bay Fair or Castro Valley BART. Gotta scope out which one's chiller.

## Tried and True

1. [Angel Island](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=468)

   I enjoyed Perimeter and Fire Rd so much when a bunch of us when in August. It's too short. I want to do a couple laps of Fire Rd. And! The ferry is such a vibe!

1. [Coyote Hills](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote-hills)

   We went through a bit of this in [September](/posts/september-2023-riding-highlights#coyote-hills-regional-park) but I keep meaning to come back. It's easy to get to from Caltrain or BART and you can throw in a bunch of [Bay Trail](https://mtc.ca.gov/operations/regional-trails-parks/san-francisco-bay-trail/bay-trail-interactive-map) and/or [Alameda Creek Trail](https://www.ebparks.org/trails/interpark/alameda-creek).
