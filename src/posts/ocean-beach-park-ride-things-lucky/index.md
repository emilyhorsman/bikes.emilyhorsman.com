A highlight of the [Prop L](https://fundthebus.com) campaign has been volunteers, often new to advocacy, building lasting relationships with each other. Some of us went and rode our favorite route through Golden Gate Park — including Connor on [loosey brakus](/tags/loosey-brakus/), Kat on her favorite Trek, and Micah on Kat's [bb-1](/tags/bb-1/). And can't forget Rosanne's beautiful new [Quercus berberidifolia](https://www.scenicroutessf.com/), violet.

Last week had a lot of very low-light photography. Cranking the ISO up to 12,800 and then often pushing a couple stops in post. I often like the grain but the colors suffer.

A previous photo of Rosanne's new bike, for good measure.

And their first test ride.

It was also the [Muni Diaries](https://www.munidiaries.com/) Art Market last weekend. I got a bunch of [Mewni prints](https://www.blacksheepcomics.com/shop?category=Mewni). Kat and Sarah did a fantastic job organizing it and KALW was the perfect space for it. Over 700 attendees!

So many of [Kurt's](http://www.yellowlineart.com/) paintings!

And then right after the art market I finally got to watch Michael's new band play. They're called Things Lucky and they have basically no internet presence and won't do streaming services — I love it. You gotta catch them by word-of-mouth. You can listen to Michael talk about it on [BFF.fm](https://bff.fm/broadcasts/45044).

Zora and Michael were also both excellent Prop L volunteers! I'm so lucky to have worked with the best.
