I love toodling around on this bike!! It's become my favourite bike to take on my 2.5km commute to the bike shop — I just bike right past the counter to my bench and fold it up. The bag is perfect for what I need for the shop and it makes the straight-line down JFK Promenade nimble and fun. I'm kind of excited to try commuting to my day job on it. Anywho, I made some fun upgrades to it.

## Eazy Wheels

I got the first-party Brompton [eazy wheels](https://us.brompton.com/p/684/eazy-wheel-rollers-with-fittings-6mm-holes). These should come stock and it makes me lose some respect for Brompton that they're not. Basically they're a smidge bigger than the stock wheels on the rear triangle and have sealed bearings instead of a plain bushing. The problem with C Line Bromptons is the wheels by the suspension block are a crumple zone for a weak part of the frame. It voids your warranty to use third-party eazy wheels that would improve how the bike rolls when folded.[^1] From Brompton support:

> The roller wheels sold by Brompton are designed to fail in the event of an impact, instead of transferring that impact to the frame, which can lead to damage. Many of the 3rd party roller wheels are designed to be stiffer and sturdier; this puts extra stress on the tubes that hold the roller wheels and can cause them to bend or crack over time or in the event of an impact.

[^1]: Although I think the gimmick with Bromptons is that they just don't roll well folded. I've talked to a bunch of other Brompton owners who love theirs and there's kind of universal agreement amongst people I respect that things like 'shopping cart mode' are a lie.

Here's the stock one on the right beside the eazy wheel.

Cat paw for scale. It's really not much bigger.

## Bubbly Pedals

TODO

## Dynamo Lighting!

I got the 'semi-radially' laced [SON XS hub](https://nabendynamo.de/en/products/hub-dynamos/for-folding-bikes/) on a stock Brompton rim. These are the hubs that SON makes for a 16" wheel with a 74mm OLD. It came from [Peter White](https://www.peterwhitecycles.com) with a nice bolt-on skewer — stoked to have access to the front wheel with a 4mm allen instead of a 15mm wrench.
