I've been helping out with [Prop L](https://fundthebus.com) â€” a measure to fund Muni[^1] with a business tax on ride-hail companies. It's peak campaigning season here in San Francisco and it's probably the busiest I've ever been in my life. I wasn't doing much biking for most of it but now I'm running canvassing events all over the city. I bring ~150lbs of campaign lit, a table, window signs, etc with a 6' [Bikes at Work](https://www.bikesatwork.com/) trailer. Multiple times a week! I have lots of thoughts on carrying stuff that I won't get to for a while.

[^1]: San Francisco's public transit system â€” the oldest publicly-operated transit agency in the United States.

[egret](/tags/egret) is in desperate need of some love â€” the front light isn't working, I changed the front brake pads while waiting for my volunteers to come back from knocking doors, and Kat just re-tensioned some spokes on the rear wheel at a campaign event. I'm pretty sure I've worn the chain way past 1% and that'll just have to be, sadly.

Anyway, I wanted to dump some photos on here and just mention that our volunteers are the absolute best and we are doing incredible work. Please come [join us](https://fundthebus.com/volunteer) if you're in San Francisco or [donate](https://fundthebus.com/donate) if you're in the US! Uber and Lyft have put up [nearly a million dollars](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAb_nIkgT9X/) against us. We're gonna beat them anyway.

Going all over the city for events has let me stumble upon all the best nooks and crannies of the city. It's the most fulfilling way to get a deeper connection with the place I live. And I'm reminded of my dear late friend Hansel. They were a social worker for the city and went to a lot of the same underappreciated areas of the city we go for the campaign. They always posted the best, casually beautiful photos of little bits of the city â€” when the light hits the right way or the right colors meet the beloved fog.

This is what the bike trailer often looks like for events.

A lot of my non-drive side rear wheel spokes loosened up. Kat did a quick re-tension while we waited for folks to come back from knocking on doors.
