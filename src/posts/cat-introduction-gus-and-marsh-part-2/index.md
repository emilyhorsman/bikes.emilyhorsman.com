## Day 3 â€” Mon, Dec 30th

Many successes today! We did two new things today. We cracked the pocket doors an inch and let them play footsie with each other. Gus puffed his tail a little bit just for a moment but then got super relaxed and playful. They did this again later and it went really well. We also did a "site swap." Gus went into the quarantine room and Marsh got to explore the rest of the apartment. They both sniffed what they needed to sniff and were quite relaxed about it all.

Marsh has a lot of moods. He's been biting some, not bearing down, just putting his teeth on you. Gus used to do this and we trained him out of it by always disengaging immediately. With Marsh we leave the room entirely when he does it. He did that to my leg for no reason I could figure out as he was leaving from a very sweet cuddle session. His fosters have said he's not a lap guy, and that's true, but half his body was in my cross-legged lap! Gus doesn't like doing that kind of thing so this was an interesting difference.
