I think it's an incredible era to be into photography. Photography as we consider it is hardly 200 years old. The medium feels hardly tapped despite its ubiquity. I think it's something of a shame that we mostly consume it through advertisements and Instagram. It's become cool these days to talk about ~ _photo books_ ~ and ways to consume photography that feel more like what the medium deserves.

## San Francisco

1. [Photoworks](https://www.photoworkssf.com/) has a local zine of analog photography.
1. [San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection](https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/historical-photographs)
1. [Harvey Milk Photo Center](https://www.harveymilkphotocenter.org/) — they have classes and a huge collection of books.
1. The [Leica store in SF](https://gallery.leicastoresf.com/) has wonderful galleries.[^1]
1. CCSF has a [photography department](https://ccsfphoto.wordpress.com/) and you can enroll for free if you're a SF resident. I'm taking [PHOT 50A (History & Aesthetics Pre-1945)](https://www.ccsf.edu/courses/spring-2025/histaesthetics-pre-1945-35393) and [PHOT 51 (Beginning Photography)](https://www.ccsf.edu/courses/spring-2025/beginning-photography-35590) and it's great!

[^1]: Lucien, the gallery coordinator, is an incredibly sweet person who cares a lot about photography. He also sold me my treasured Leica M!

## General

1. So many photographers have great websites were they publish their work. It's often sorted into projects — a lovely way to consume photography. It's so much nicer than looking at a small phone. Here's some I love: [[1]](https://www.xuanhuing.com/) [[2]](https://connor.photo/) [[3]](https://www.alecreidhughes.com/)
1. I'm actually going to defend [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilyhorsman/) a little bit, which I know is sort of a wild thing to do in 2025.
1. I've been enjoying [Elements](https://www.elementsphotomag.com/) magazine for a long time.
1. Marc Levoy's Lectures on Digital Photography. The course website is [here](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/home?authuser=0) and the Internet Archive has the videos [here](https://archive.org/details/marc-levoy-lectures-digital-photography) if ever needed.
