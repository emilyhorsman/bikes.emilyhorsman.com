title: Shimano CUES Drivetrain Upgrade for Egret
summary: Attempting to solve the chain retention and shifting issues on my e-bike with a new drivetrain. Now it's got a narrow-wide chainring, a clutched rear derailleur, and the extra chainline increases the gap so the chain can't get stuck.

Egret has a new drivetrain! This bike has had [inboard chain retention](/posts/1x-ebike-chain-retention-problems) and minor shifting issues. I've wondered if a clutched derailleur, narrow-wide chainring, and [Linkglide](/posts/linkglide-di2-incompatible-with-e6100#why-linkglide-and-di2) would help. I've also wanted to try the new CUES groupset.

## Parts

1. Chainring: [SM-CRE80](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/ep6-ep600/SM-CRE80.html) — it turns out the splines are the same as the [SM-CRE61](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/SM-CRE61.html) and work on an [E6100](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/DU-E6100.html) system.
1. Rear Derailleur: [RD-U8000](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/cues-u8000/RD-U8000.html) — this is the 1x version that takes up to a 50t cassette.
1. Shifter: [SL-U8000-11R](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/cues-u8000/SL-U8000-11R.html) — it would've been nice to get the I-Spec version for some better ergonomics with the brake lever but that would require a new brake lever and my current ones are just fine.
1. Cassette: [CS-LG700-11](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/cues-u8000/CS-LG700-11.html) 11-45t
1. Chain: [CN-LG500](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/ep8-ep800/CN-LG500.html) — [waxed!](/posts/chain-wax)

For the weight weenies out there:

Here's the motor unit stripped of its old chainring. You can see the witness marks from the chain getting stuck between the motor and the old chainring.

I should've cleaned it up before putting the new chainring on but it was getting pretty late and I had an edible waiting for me at home.

I initially thought the derailleur looked kind of ugly. It's a lot like its prettier Deore counterpart but the faceplate on the parallelogram and B-knuckle area look cheap. Ben and I came around on it once it was on the frame though — it sorta matches.

Disappointingly, they don't offer a silver cassette. This one is black with an interesting finish that catches the light in a fun way — I don't hate it. The old cassette that came with the bike had dug into my aluminum freehub body splines pretty badly. I should've taken a photo. It took about ten minutes to get the cassette off the splines. This CS-LG700 cassette has an aluminum carrier so hopefully I won't have the same problem. This bike will probably have a steel freehub body in its future.

This chainring bumped the front chainline from 50mm to 46.5mm. It's pretty extreme for the non-boost 135mm spacing in the rear. Seems to work fine so far but it's definitely not ideal. Chainline is probably bullshit until it isn't anyway.

The derailleur hanger isn't _perfectly_ aligned and I didn't have time to swap housing. I think the old housing is a little short and maybe poorly routed around the motor. This might contribute to some shifting woes. Nonetheless, the shifting is noticeably better than the old drivetrain.

## Results

1. No chain retention issues so far and it has been out in the gravel a couple times. Stoked about this. The narrow-wide ring is so much prettier than the old, cheaper ring with a plastic chainguard.
1. The clutch on this derailleur is _very_ strong. I might try lightening it up a bit.
1. Linkglide shifting feels _different_. It does seem to shift smoother under load than before. It's not as noticeable as I expected, other than the shifting being more obedient than the previous drivetrain. Although, it does seem more graceful when you don't get your shift timing right. One day I will get the time to get the derailleur hanger perfectly straight and ensure the housing is sorted out. The chainline might always be a limiting factor in shifting performance but I wanna give this the best shot.
1. The immediate release feature on this shifter feels weird! I like it, but it's strange. Upshifts occur right when you press the lever instead of after you press and release it.
1. Shimano doesn't have a range than 11-45 for their 11-speed Linkglide cassettes. I thought this would be overkill on this e-bike (coming from the old 11-34) but I've ended up appreciating it, especially while riding with others. It probably has some battery benefits, too.

_Very_ excited to see how long I can get out of this waxed chain and Linkglide cassette.
