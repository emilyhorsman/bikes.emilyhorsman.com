Kind of a low mileage month, unfortunately. Life happens. BUT, Kat built her [new Bridgestone](/tags/bb-1). My [waxed](/posts/chain-wax) drivetrain is continuing to work great. We were in Los Angeles for a few days and didn't get to bike there but we did walk around the bike path on the river and I'm very stoked to bike there someday. Also, rain riding! I love riding in the rain and the rain is back! Enjoying my rare San Francisco rainy days.

## Ripping on the Bridgestone

Here it is!! It's not its final configuration but that hasn't stopped us from taking it out on the trails.

I truly do not come up to the Marin Headlands often enough. I biked up Marincello for the first time and I think Bobcat is a better climb but Marincello is so beautiful.

We truly got the best sunset for the Bridgestone's first Headlands ride.

## Night Moves

A bunch of us rode up to the top of Bobcat in the Marin Headlands in the quiet night. I haven't ridden trails in the dark much and it was a great experience. When we descended Julian Trail the owls would all fly out as we came down.

Hansel's Platypus out on the trails with that beautiful Fab's chest.

We saw shooting stars from up here. Jay saw a couple deer but I missed 'em.

Riding down Bobcat in the dark was _cold_ and the corrugations were rough but it was so much fun.

## Clancy's for the Scenic Routes Christmas Tree

Another Clancy's run to get a tree for the [bike shop](https://scenicroutessf.com/). Atlas is a lot more enthused than Goldberg here.

Prepping a space for it.

Wildly autumnal vibes — rare for the city.

Shoutout to Tim for operating this dope fucking tree baler!! It happens so fast. No hayride this time but the machinery was cool. They shake out your tree and then bale it. Then everybody else puts it on top of their car and we put it in a bike trailer because you really, _really_ do not need a car.

The ~8' tall tree fit perfectly on the 6' trailer.

Apologies to this reindeer, who lost an antler in the ride, and uhhh, I dunno, certainly is in a pose of sorts.

## Golden Gate Park Trails

Super stoked that the trails have gotten some rain and aren't so dry and loose. Kat and I have been exploring the trails on the north side of the park. These used to be a lil too rowdy for me (I am not a mountain biker) but I've been having a lot of fun on them lately.

We have a new go-to park trail loop! Taking the north trails going west and the south trails going east.

## Around San Francisco

We saw vintage streetcar [#1050](https://www.streetcar.org/streetcars/1050-1050-stlouis/) on the J Church line while biking to the Mission!!

I'm building a [Corsi-Rosenthal](https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/) air filter cube for the bike shop. I don't love using voilé straps when I can't properly tension them but I was in a pinch and it worked great in the end.

Aaaaand it's Gus. Also we hate ordering from Chewy but he's a special boy on a prescription diet and Chewy/PetSmart are the only places that will fill a food prescription. It's bullshit! There aren't even any active ingredients in the food! Anyway, [fuck Big Pet](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom). He does _love_ the box.
