Our second year in a row ([last year](/posts/november-2023-riding-highlights/#clancyâ€™s-for-the-scenic-routes-christmas-tree)) of grabbing a tree from Clancy's for the bike shop! And like then, [egret](/tags/egret) carried the tree on the 6' trailer, no problem. It even seems easier to load a tree up on the trailer than on a car.

Atlas doesn't bark in the Omnium like he did in the Burley! He's so cute.

Detail shot of Jerry's sick new Omnium that isn't even that new anymore, I just haven't had time to ride with my friends ðŸ˜­ The Outer Sunset life has taken its toll on that disc rotor though.

This straw sticking out of my stem caddy is made of gluten-free pasta and it's the best straw I've ever used.

Goldberg would please like a fried potato.

Anna and Kat unwrapped the tree, securely in its stand at the shop.

The shop is selling Cleverhoods now! Sarah is moving them out of the way of the tree. The bike shop is feeling real cozy up front these days with the new hanging merch.

I love this place.

The bike corral at Scenic Routes was overflowing. It always slaps when every rack is filled up and there's a dozen of the city's coolest bikes locked up here.

Molly and Katrin's Cricut'd (how do you make that a verb) bike ornaments!

I had my boring Sony, Connor had his Hasselblad V system, and Ben had his Hasselblad X system. ðŸ˜….
