## Day 7 — Fri, Jan 3rd

No bites or grabbing! Great work, Marsh. More importantly, Gus and Marsh met four times and it all went exceptionally well. No negative body language, no vocalizations, and they were both easy to keep semi-distracted instead of fixating on each other.

## Day 8

Marsh bit me twice, but no grabbing. Our new protocol on this is to loudly state "no bite," lean into the bite instead of trying to pull away from it, and to stop paying attention to him but not leave the room. "No bite" worked really well and he immediately disengaged.

Gus and Marsh met twice today and sadly they were tenser meets that each ended with small spats. They were both easy to separate — the first one I made one loud clap and that did the trick. Marsh even went back to the quarantine room on his own after that.

## Day 9

Marsh tried to bite me twice in the morning but they were both less aggressive than yesterday and the "no bite" command was effective again. I thiiiiink he's learning.
