My typing load at my day job has been increasing and some wrist pain has come back. Between that and trying those GS1 Evo grips with larger wings [on the Brompton](/posts/initial-brompton-setup) I've been thinking about refining my cockpit and grips on [egret](/tags/egret). I bought a variety of Ergon grips to try and the ones that don't work out will go the library at [Scenic Routes](https://scenicroutessf.com).

I seem to be between sizes for the Ergon grips. My hand circumference is right on the lower bound of their large size. The small size GS1 Evo grips didn't work well on my Brompton but the large ones do. The large ones feel a smidge big but that ends up helping with how little backsweep the Brompton stock bars have. I think putting my fingers around the large ones keeps them closer to their natural flexion at rest compared to the small ones. But then I tried the small size on egret and it worked out pretty well! [Those bars](https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/dream-riser-handlebar) are wider and have 25 degrees of backsweep. Similarly, the large GP1 Evo grips were too large and hurt my wrists pretty quickly.

One thing I don't like about the GP1 and GC1 grips are their outboard metal clamps.[^1] The metal feels harder when leaning your bars against something and the outboard position requires the full length of the grip to be on the bar (hard with the Brompton's narrow bars).

[^1]: And the naming. The naming is impossible to follow.

I also wanted to get my brake levers further inboard so that my index fingers and wrists don't have to change angles to have my finger on the furthest part of the lever blade.

The inner bar ends (Soma's Cletus extensions) also needed to be angled up a bit and I swapped their unsightly grips with [weed can](/tags/weed-can)'s old bar tape.
