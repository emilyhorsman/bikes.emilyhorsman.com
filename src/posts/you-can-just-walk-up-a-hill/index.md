You can be basically anywhere in San Francisco, step outside, and walk up a massive hill. I love it. You'll be surrounded by contradiction and engulfed in what could be. San Francisco encourages you to walk up 500ft on a whim.

I've been going on a lot of walks lately. Bikes haven't had much of a recreational spotlight this year. April to November had no time for recreational biking â€” all my time was split between my day job and working on Prop L. Walking has felt like a good way to relax after a very busy year.
