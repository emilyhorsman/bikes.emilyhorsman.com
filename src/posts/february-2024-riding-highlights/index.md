## Fri 2nd

I need to bike and walk on the paths in the sand dunes on Great Highway Park more often. These were probably the nicest conditions here all month!

Ended up at Corona Heights in the evening with rain clouds over the skyline.

## Mon 5th

We got a huge storm on the 4th. Golden Gate Park sustained a lot of damage and the trails have been pretty beat up.

## Thu 8th

Fewer coyote sightings in the park this month, but many, many heron sightings.

## Mon 12th

I biked up Medical Center Way to the nursery at Mt Sutro. Certainly a perk of the e-bike — it's very steep. Mt Sutro is weird right now — a lot of trail closures, downed trees, and road construction.

I met this cute cat, Riley (?), out for a walk with its human up there! Goals for Gus.

I took the suburban roads up from Mt Sutro to Twin Peaks. I'd do that again — there's a lot of beautiful views.

## Tue 13th

The Presidio is such a strange place but I love riding around it. I want to do a post on the [Presidio Promenade](https://presidio.gov/explore/attractions/presidio-promenade-trail) soon — saving some photos for it.

## Sat 17th

These pink-flowering currants are blooming _everywhere_ in the city right now. These ones by Lake Metson have been my favourite for a few years now.

It's been a dramatic month of weather on the Pacific. We risked the rain and got some lunch at [Beach'n](https://beachnsf.com/) — happy to have more vegan places in the city. Being vegetarian in San Francisco is pretty easy but going to Los Angeles makes me wish for more.

Kat got fenders on her Trek!

## Sun 18th

We got our bike corral at [Scenic Routes](https://www.scenicroutessf.com/)! It's so great! I'm going to take so many photos like this over the years. ft. Ben's Romanceur, Jay's Evasion, Jay's Velo Orange Campeur, and Jerry's Stumpjumper. So happy to not have a parking spot for cars right out the doors anymore.

## Mon 19th

We bailed on the Great Highway due to the extreme wind gusts here.

(It says Free Gaza)

But the vibes at Lake Metson were so good — although it gets even better on Saturday.

## Thu 22nd

We biked to [Outer Orbit](https://outerorbitsf.com/) for the screening of Sarah's debut on [Check, Please! Bay Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEVQs_LfSeQ).

## Tue 27th

Ben is also getting fenders! Some turtle-textured Honjos. I'm…25% through the install. It's hard.

## Wed 28th

I biked to China Beach thinking they'd probably be done the construction by now but turns out it was just the beginning. Now there's a whole other garden initiative happening. It's cute but I miss being able to bring my bike down. (You can, I did, but it's a lot of stairs.)
