I broke my [Ricoh GR III](https://web.archive.org/web/20241231023332/https://us.ricoh-imaging.com/product/gr-iii/) a long while ago. I rode too fast over a bump, and it launched out of my stem caddy. Ever since, the image stabilization was broken and caused the camera to erratically vibrate. Plus, the camera would lose its date/time/settings every time it powered off.

I avoided getting it repaired for a long time because I've heard that the authorized repair company — [Precision Camera](https://www.precisioncamera.com/Ricoh/) — can take a year and can cost almost as much as a new one. Not to mention, these cameras are hard to come by right now. New ones are constantly sold out, and even used ones can be harder to come by and cost as much as MSRP.

But my experience was great! Precision received my camera on Dec 18th, sent me an invoice on Dec 27th, and shipped it back on Dec 30th. I got it back on Jan 7th, and it's entirely fixed. They replaced the lens unit assembly and cleaned the body/sensor. It cost $424.50.

I wish I had done it ages ago! It has a nice used patina, including dents on the mode dial from the fall. It's my favorite camera to use while riding a bike, if not one of my favorites generally. And it's super light and easy to use when my RSI flares up.
