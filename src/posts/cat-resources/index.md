## Blogs

1. [what your cat wants](https://whatyourcatwants.com/) by Mikel Delgado

## Books

1. [Starting from Scratch](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/300884/starting-from-scratch-by-pam-johnson-bennett/) by Pam Johnson-Bennett. This is great â€” just ignore the constant plugging for Feliway.

## San Francisco

My favorite pet stores in San Francisco are [The Animal House](https://theanimalhousesf.com/) in the Haight and [Pet's Corner](https://petscornershop.com/) in the Inner Richmond.
