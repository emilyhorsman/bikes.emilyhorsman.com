Great month of riding. Lots of rain, lots of shorter rides â€” turning errands into longer rides, that kind of thing.

## Across the Bridge

Kat and I went across the bridge and down to Fort Baker just for the lols. Man, Fort Baker is a depressing place. omg. The vibes elsewhere were great though. I think I only made it across once this month.

We got some good sunsets this month.

I always take the Coastal Trail instead of Lincoln after Washington Blvd now. No car interactions and it's beautiful.

## Night Shots

I've been riding in the evening a lot more this month. Busy during the day and the sunset is still pretty soon after work. But I've been going to the Great Walkway more often.

And I finally biked to Corona Heights. It really needs bike parking â€” I'm going to email the Randall Museum and see what they think. There's a trail closed at the top, too!

I've been biking through the Presidio more as well, kind of by chance. Park Blvd is a whole vibe at night.

## Bus Only

I stopped behind [#1071](https://www.streetcar.org/streetcars/1071-1071-minneapolis-st-paul-mn/) on Market St a couple times.

## Russian Hill

We had a summer-like day in January and I had an errand by Chinatown. I biked up Grant and then across Pacific and up Polk. It was just me and my e-bike so I biked up some big hills I normally wouldn't, around Francisco Park. I ended up (finally!) going down the curvy Lombard block. Its aesthetic is kinda ruined by cars, unfortunately, but it was very fun.

Biking down Hyde is _wild_ â€” you hear and feel the rumble of the cable car system. The bend of Larkin St around Francisco Park gets you a great view of the Powell-Hyde cable car.

{% image "L1008354.jpg" "The Powell-Hyde cable car on a steep hill in front of a white building" %}
{% image "L1008365.jpg" "Looking down at a road from a railing above" %}

The cars were not kind around here. Rich assholes.

I'm never around this part of town â€” I love how biking can turn errands into exploration.

## Hansel

## Great Walkway Hangs

The new bench at Great Walkway & Noriega.

Goldberg would much rather be at home than at the in-between biking bar hang.

{% image "L1008408.jpg" "Goldberg resting on Sarah's leg" %}

Atlas ðŸ˜­

Look at that floof ðŸ‘€.

## Where Jerry

Kat and I bike to the Outer Sunset a lot and naturally, run into Jerry.

{% image "L1008034.jpg" "Kat and Jerry looking at a moody Pacific Ocean" %}
{% image "DSCF1736.jpg" "Jerry looking at a sunset composed between him and the Burley trailer with Atlas" %}

It looks like Kat is signalling a turn but she's just fist pumping to Atlas' barks. Atlas recently got brought up by a stranger on reddit (eugh) because his barking from the trailer makes their day.

## Riding with Jay!!

Kat and I did a park trail spin with Jay. Enjoying some of our favorite chill single track.

And we saw a coyote, of course!

## Golden Gate Park Dirt

I got out on the [Hardtack](/tags/weed-can) more this month and really enjoyed it! I need to dial in the position for climbing efficiency though. The trails in the park are muddy right now! I couldn't get over this last bit uphill here and had to bail.

{% image "DSCF1966.jpg" "A foggy day looking at trees and a muddy incline from the top of it" %}

{% image "DSCF1977.jpg" "The upper half of a muddy pink bike resting against a bench" %}

{% image "DSCF1116.jpg" "Kat biking into the sun with swooping trees above her and large muddy puddles behind her" %}
{% image "DSCF1203.jpg" "Kat biking on some single track between two trees" %}

The [BB-1](/tags/bb-1) looks good everywhere.

{% image "DSCF1238.jpg" "A blue and gold Bridgestone BB-1 resting against a tree" %}
{% image "DSCF1712.jpg" "Kat biking down some forested single track with a lot of green grass" %}

This dahlia(?) was a very short bloom. We rode by the same spot at Metson Lake this month to see it bloom and leave.

{% image "DSCF1338.jpg" "A flower with seven violet petals and a yellow center" %}

In speaking of, the dahlias are all gone on JFK Promenade, too.

## Rain

So much rain this month! We went out riding in it a fair bit. Here's barely visible Kat riding through heavy rain in the dark.

{% image "DSCF1995.jpg" "Kat biking in the rain, very dark, hard to see her, some raindrops illuminated" %}

## Anti-Car Action

A tree fell in Golden Gate Park and smooshed several cars. It caused hella traffic on JFK since Overlook was closed.

{% image "DSCF1963.jpg" "A dark view of the winding JFK road with cars lined up into the vanishing point" %}

## Andytown

I feel like I went to the Lawton Andytown _so_ many times this month.

{% image "DSCF1818.jpg" "Kat taking a photo towards the ocean with Jerry rolling up on his bike" %}
{% image "DSCF1830.jpg" "Goldberg in a little hoodie sitting in the bike basket looking at the camera" %}

## Slow Ride Testing

Kat and I were out testing the [latest slow ride route](https://www.safestreetrebel.com/blog/feb-11th-slow-is-where-the-heart-is-slow-ride/). 22nd St & Minnesota Slow Street is such a vibe.

{% image "DSCF1630.jpg" "A yellow building on the corner of an intersection with a bench on the other side" %}

I biked up the last block of Somerset after Woolsey, which is extremely steep, to see if the e-bike could do it. Flawlessly! Coming back down was kinda scary.

{% image "DSCF1614.jpg" "Looking down a curving road with a bike sharrow marker on it" %}

There's not an ideal way to to bike to Balboa Park BART Station. Coming up Geneva to San Jose has a bus lane you can use (with some guilt) but oof, the hill with the traffic around there is no ideal.

{% image "DSCF1592.jpg" "Looking up a red bus lane beside a 'San Jose' street sign" %}

Arlington is always so pretty!

{% image "DSCF1587.jpg" "Kat biking towards the crest of a hill in dappled shadows" %}

## New Valencia Bike Lane

I do not like this bike lane. I rode it in full for the first time since its completion. It starts with a diagonal merge across 15th St that relies on a bike-only signal.

{% image "DSCF1565.jpg" "A bike lane with green bike markers cutting across an intersection" %}
{% image "DSCF1566.jpg" "Looking behind a rider going down a two-way center running bike lane with bollars on each side" %}

And then ends on 22nd with a similar merge. Palestine free in our lifetime, I hope.

## Misc

I don't normally take Masonic and Geary to the Presidio but I do enjoy looking over the grade split.

The paths back here by the Conservatory of Flowers are a fun toodle on my [Brompton](/tags/n-judah-explore).

ngl I took too many photos this month and got bogged down in actually making a nice blog post.
