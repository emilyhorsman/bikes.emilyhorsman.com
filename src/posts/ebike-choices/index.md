In my opinion, your choices are rather limited if you're looking for an all-rounder e-bike that has good bones and isn't too heavy, isn't too ugly, doesn't have a suspension fork, has a neutral riding position, and can carry lots of stuff but isn't a Cargo E-Bike(tm). Basically: a maintainable bike for everyone that doesn't have a specialized usage. For instance, my Kona Dew-E (["egret"](/tags/egret)) regularly carries lots of cargo and I ride it for recreation and errands.[^1] Including on moderate dirt and gravel (essentially, Rivendell's view of a trail bike â€” you should be able to take a bike off the road, but you're not doing jumps/etc).

[^1]: I don't have a take on whether a Kona Dew-E is the right bike, or not. It certainly has a lot of things to nitpick. Also for many, an e-bike is a substantial financial decision and Kona as a company [isn't doing so great right now](https://www.bicycleretailer.com/retail-news/2023/06/26/retailers-unimpressed-konas-new-d2c-program). That means your warranty, for whatever good it's worth, might not have a company backing it.

I don't really do product recommendations or reviews on this blog and don't intend to. But there are two folks in my life looking for such an e-bike and it's been on my mind a lot regardless.

## What would be a perfect e-bike?

1. Testable in a store and assembled by a qualified mechanic. Not direct-to-consumer.
1. Rigid fork
1. Shimano or Bosch mid-drive motor
1. Easily removable battery with reputable replacements. Any Shimano dealer can order me a replacement battery for my E6100 system.
1. Rack and fender mounts on the front and rear.
1. <50lbs
1. Kickstand or ability to add one
1. Hydraulic disc brakes with mineral oil
1. No carbon
1. Minimal cockpit shenanigans
1. Shimano Linkglide
1. Tubeless compatible
1. Doesn't come with contact points: you choose.
1. Serviceable with parts that non-specialized bike shops can get. No niche things like the TRP Flow Set Control[^2] brakes that Specialized puts on its [Como SL](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-como-sl-40/p/216528?color=348461-216528).

[^2]: You can't even find mention of these in TRP's catalog! One time I had to replace the caliper on this bike and our only option was to order a caliper/level pair through our friend at a Specialized dealer. Why not just use Shimano hydraulics?
