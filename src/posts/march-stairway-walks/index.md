These stairways are often surrounded by single family houses. Sometimes they're even the way to a main entrance of one. I used to walk around a lot of these central SF stairways when I first started hanging out in San Francisco seven years ago. When I walk around these now, they're surrounded by Private Property signs, Ring cameras, and security systems. In Corona Heights? The magic of these stairways feels lost when walking along the result of NextDoor style FUD. It doesn't feel like a whimsical part of the city we share, it feels like the policed backyard of fortunate homeowners.
